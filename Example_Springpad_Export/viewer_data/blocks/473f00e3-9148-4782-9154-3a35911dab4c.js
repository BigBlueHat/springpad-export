"description":"<DIV>Who am I? Why am I here?  What is the nature of the world around me?<BR>Alan Watts (1915 \u2013 1973)\u2014noted professor, graduate-school dean, Harvard University research fellow, and Episcopal priest\u2014examines these fundamental questions from a Taoist perspective, learning to appreciate not just the bowl but the empty space within it.  With down-to-earth writing he reveals our direct connection to the natural world and reminds us that we are not so much born into this world as grown out of it. This collection of eight of Watts' unique philosophical essays and an early piece written in 1953 has a brief introduction by Alan's son, Mark Watts, which gives the background of these pieces and  their place in Alan Watts' life and work.<BR><\/div>",
